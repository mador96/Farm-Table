Progress:

The app loads and opens on the "Login" page.

Progress towards a major feature: As of now, our "screens"/"major features" include the login activity, registration activity, and profile and edit profile activities. We are currently working on hooking up the user profile information stored in Firebase to populate users' profiles and store food items/products sellers offer.

Progress towards two optional features:
1. Data storage using key/value pair storage: We are using SharedPreferences to store the username/passwords of users. When a user registers, their login credentials are stored in SharedPreferences as a key-value pair. We lookup user credentials using SharedPreferences when users login to the app to ensure that the information is correct.

2. Build and consume your own web service using a third-party platform: We are using firebase to store buyer and seller objects. When you press register it opens to a page that will be the search page and displays the sellers that are currently stored in the database. Clicking on a seller will open their profile which will be populate with their information
