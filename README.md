#Project Description:

  This app, Farm Table, aims to make local, fresh food more easily accessible to communities across the
country. Many communities in America struggle with food insecurity, or only have access to
mass-produced, preservative-laced foods. Furthermore, even for communities that do host regular
farmers markets, residents may find that items are too expensive, or that the market is held at times that
they are unavailable. Farm Table intends to alleviate these issues by enabling both local farmers and
residents to buy and sell foods they grow, whether it be from their farms or their personal backyard
gardens, to those around them. Sellers and buyers have the freedom to meet at times convenient for
them to exchange goods and payment, not strictly at times when a farmers market is open. Furthermore,
without the additional cost of transportation and by enabling any resident to sell foods they grow, the
items on the Farm Table app will be, on average, cheaper than those usually offered at farmers markets,
and users do not need to arrange their schedules around times that a farmers market will be open. All in
all, Farm Table will alleviate the issue of lack of accessibility to fresh, local foods through its online
marketplace.

#This app is able to do the following:

● Both Buyers and Sellers
  - The system shall allows users can register on the app as a Seller or a Buyer, using a
  username and password of their choice
  - The system shall allow users to view their profile, where they can set their name on the
  app, their location/address, email, and a profile picture
  - Monetary transactions between sellers and buyers will happen outside of the app through
  Venmo
  
  
● Sellers Only
  - The system shall allows Sellers to view the items in their pantry (their inventory), and add
  items to their pantry
  - The system shall allows Sellers to view orders placed by buyers requesting one of their
  items
  - The system shall allows Sellers to click on an order request to mark it as “done”, or to
  view the contact information of the buyer requesting the order
  - The system shall integrate SQLite to enable Sellers to update their pantry without an
  internet connection
  

● Buyers Only
  - The system shall dynamically read from a database a list of items that each Seller offers
  - The system shall allows Buyers to search items offered by all sellers on the app and add
  desired items to their cart
  - The system shall allows Buyers to view the items in their cart and generate an order for
  those items
  - The system shall allows Buyers to clear all the items in their cart at once, or delete
  individual items by clicking on that item in the list
